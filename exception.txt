list is to store values


[1,2,3] - for list , we have to define the size ex: int[3]
	- we cannot change the sze dynamically

[10,20,30] - size can be changed dynamically
	   - we dont need to define size for array list
	   - adding and deleting takes time

[100,200,300] - size can be changed dynamically
	   	- we dont need to define size for Linked list
		- fetching a value takes time

{1:2,20:30,40:50} - key value pair
		- iterate to get keys and values


try - where we write our code for execution
catch block - to catch any exceptions that are happening in try block
exception - any runtime errors related to code like arithmetic,null pointer, arrayindexoutofbounds
finally block - where we want to close any connections or final code that we want to execute at the end of run/script
error - system exceptions like outofmemory and force errors which are like assertions(comparing the actual value vs expected value)

throw - forcibly to throw an exception
